### State Hook

This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments the value:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```


Here, useState is a Hook (we‚Äôll talk about what this means in a moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It‚Äôs similar to `this.setState` in a class, except it doesn‚Äôt merge the old and new state together. (We‚Äôll show an example comparing `useState` to `this.state` in [[using-the-state-hook]].)

The only argument to `useState` is the initial state. In the example above, it is `0` because our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike `this.state`, the state here doesn‚Äôt have to be an object ‚Äî although it can be if you want. The initial state argument is only used during the first render.


### Declaring multiple state variables
You can use the State Hook more than once in a single component:

```js
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  // ...
}
```

The [[array-destructuring]] syntax lets us give different names to the state variables we declared by calling `useState`. These names aren‚Äôt a part of the useState API. Instead, React assumes that if you call useState many times, you do it in the same order during every render. We‚Äôll come back to why this works and when this is useful later.

### But what is a Hook?

Hooks are functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features from function components


### ‚ö°Ô∏è Effect Hook
You‚Äôve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù (or ‚Äúeffects‚Äù for short) because they can affect other components and can‚Äôt be done during rendering.

The Effect Hook, `useEffect`, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API. (We‚Äôll show examples comparing useEffect to these methods in [[using-the-effect-hook]].)

For example, this component sets the document title after React updates the DOM

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you call `useEffect`, you‚Äôre telling React to run your ‚Äúeffect‚Äù function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render ‚Äî including the first render.

Effects may also optionally specify how to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù after them by returning a function. For example, this component uses an effect to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status, and cleans up by unsubscribing from it:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
```

In this example, React would unsubscribe from our `ChatAPI` when the component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render. (If you want, there‚Äôs a way to tell React to skip re-subscribing if the`props.friend.id` we passed to `ChatAPI` didn‚Äôt change.)

Just like with `useState`, you can use more than a single effect in a component:

```js
function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  // ...
```

Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what pieces are related (such as adding and removing a subscription), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.

### ‚úåÔ∏è Rules of Hooks

* Only call Hooks **at the top level**. Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
* Only call Hooks from [[react-function-components]]. Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks ‚Äî your own custom Hooks. We‚Äôll learn about them in a moment.)

### üí°Building Your Own Hooks
Sometimes, we want to reuse some stateful logic between components. Traditionally, there were two popular solutions to this problem: higher-order components and render props. Custom Hooks let you do this, but without adding more components to your tree.

Earlier on this page, we introduced a `FriendStatus` component that calls the `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status. Let‚Äôs say we also want to reuse this subscription logic in another component.

First, we‚Äôll extract this logic into a custom Hook called useFriendStatus:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return isOnline;
}
```

It takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether our friend is online.

Now we can use it from both components

```js
unction FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}


function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
}
```

The state of these components is completely independent. Hooks are a way to reuse [[stateful-logic]], not state itself. In fact, each call to a Hook has a completely isolated state ‚Äî so you can even use the same custom Hook twice in one component.

Custom Hooks are more of a convention than a feature. If a function‚Äôs name starts with ‚Äù`use`‚Äù and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The `useSomething` naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the code using Hooks.

You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven‚Äôt considered. We are excited to see what custom Hooks the React community will come up with.
